## Minimizer
A structure for performing energy minimization and conformational analysis of molecular systems.

### Fields
- `sample: Sampler` - The sampler object containing the initial molecular system and sampling parameters.

- `minimized: Vec<System>` - A vector containing the minimized molecular systems for each sampled conformation.

- `energy: Vec<f64>` - The potential energies (in `KCal/mol`) corresponding to each minimized conformation.

- `angles: Vec<Vec<f64>>` - The optimized dihedral angles (in `degrees`) for each minimized conformation.

### Methods

- `new` - Creates a new Minimizer instance initialized with the provided Sampler (sample: Sampler) and returns a new Minimizer instance (Self). The vectors for minimized systems, energies, and angles are pre-allocated based on the number of samples in the Sampler.

- `diff` - Calculates the energy of a given dihedral angle configuration using a provided function (`Arc<dyn Fn(Vec<f64>) -> f64>`) that calculates energy from dihedral angles (wrapped in an Arc for thread safety) and a vector of dihedral angles to evaluate (`Vec<f64>`). Returns a tuple containing the energy value at the given angles (`f64`) and a vector of energy gradients with respect to each angle (`Vec<f64>`). The function performs numerical differentiation of the energy function with respect to the angles.

- `minimize` - Performs energy minimization on all sampled conformations using the L-BFGS algorithm. Optimizes the dihedral angles to find local energy minima. Updates the minimized systems, energies, and angles vectors with the optimization results. Returns no value.

- `conformational_sort` - Sorts the conformations based on their Boltzmann weights at `300K`. Reorders the minimized systems, energies, and angles vectors according to the conformational weights in descending order. Higher weights indicate more thermodynamically favorable conformations. Returns no value.

- `write_angles` - Writes the optimized dihedral angles and corresponding energies to a specified file (`&str`). Each line contains the conformation index, energy, and comma-separated angles. Returns a `Result<()>` indicating success or failure of the file operation.

- `to_pdb` - Writes all conformations to a PDB format file specified by filename (`&str`). Includes both the initial system and all minimized conformations. Each MODEL entry contains atomic coordinates and the corresponding energy. Returns a `Result<()>` indicating success or failure of the file operation.

### Example
```rust
use libdncs::*;

// Configuration
const NAME: &str = "DNCS";
const SEQUENCE: &str = "YGGFM";
const FORCE_FIELD: FF = FF::AMBERFB15;
const NO_OF_SAMPLE: usize = 10;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // System
    let mut sys = System::new(SEQUENCE, FORCE_FIELD.init());
    sys.init_parameters();
    // Sample
    let mut sample = Sampler::new(sys);
    println!("Generating Samples..");
    sample.sample(NO_OF_SAMPLE);
    // Minimizer
    let mut minimizer = Minimizer::new(sample);
    println!("Executing Minimizer..");
    minimizer.minimize();
    minimizer.conformational_sort();
    minimizer.write_angles(&format!("{}.out", NAME))?;
    minimizer.to_pdb("minimized.pdb")?;
    println!("Completed!");
    Ok(())
}
```
